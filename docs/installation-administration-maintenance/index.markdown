This section contains information on how install Cocov from scratch, configure
and administer its facilities, and how to perform maintenance procedures
on an existing instance.

Regardless of what of those activities you are looking forward to perform,
a good place to begin is understanding each of Cocov's
{% doclink "Platform Components" %}, which will present each moving piece
of software that composes a Cocov instance. Then, feel free to continue to
the section you were looking for.
