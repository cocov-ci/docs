The Adminland Repositories section provides an overall view of all
repositories, their resource usage, and the amount of users that have access
to them.

Administrators are able to easily remove a repository, and the following
features are planned to be introduced in future versions:

- Per-repository data management, allowing old data and caches to be purged
from the repository list.
- Per-repository permission synchronization, from the same list.
- Obtain a list of users with access to a given repository.
