Personal Access Tokens allows users to be able to make requests to an instance's
API, allowing data and other statistics to be obtained in a programmatic
fashion. Unlike service tokens, all operations made through PATs are tied to the
user that generated it, meaning that they are valid as long as a user is part of
the organization and present in the instance's user list.
