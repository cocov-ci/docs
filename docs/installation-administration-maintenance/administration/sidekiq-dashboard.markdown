Cocov allows administrators to easily access the Sidekiq dashboard in order to
observe or troubleshoot background jobs. For information regarding how to use
the Sidekiq Web Interface, please refer to [Sidekiq's Documentation](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki).

To access the dashboard, make sure you have direct access to the API. Then,
access the Adminland through the Web UI, and finally choose _Access Dashboard_
under the _General_ page:
